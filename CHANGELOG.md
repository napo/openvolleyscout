# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Quick scouting mode rewritten around a DataVolley-compatible 3-touch cycle
  (reception/dig → set → attack), with colored selection rings per touch type
  and skill-aware prompts
- Reception "=" now auto-commits as reception error and ends the rally
- Point confirmation now requested for all rally-ending actions in quick mode
  (attack kill/error, block kill/error, ace, reception error, serve error),
  matching standard/advanced mode behavior

### Added
- New setting: "Require point confirmation" (Settings → Scouting) — when
  enabled, asks for confirmation before assigning a point via the court
  (graphical input); manual code entry always confirms regardless of this
  setting
- Marker size slider in Settings
- Setter position tracking on touches
- Tooltips for evaluation and combination code buttons in the live toolbar

### Fixed
- Side-out distribution calculation per rotation
- v0.4.0 release was broken (missing file caused CI build failure on all
  platforms — no binaries were ever published for that tag); 0.5.0
  supersedes it
- Tiebreak Tech import: `import.meta.env` usage in the parser was silently
  breaking the local test suite under ts-node, causing 8 test files to never
  run; fixed and all tests now pass

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- Match report calculation and display fixes

### Added
- Tiebreak Tech (.db) database import support
- In-app auto-update: desktop builds check for new versions on startup and show an update dialog with download and install options
